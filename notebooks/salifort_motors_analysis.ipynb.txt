# 🏭 Salifort Motors: Employee Turnover Prediction

## 📌 Plan Stage

In this project, I am a data professional working for a fictional company called **Salifort Motors**.  
Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among employees, including both voluntary resignations and terminations.  
This turnover is costly for the company due to recruitment, training, and productivity loss.

**Objective:**  
- Build a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will stay or leave.  
- Identify the most influential factors contributing to turnover.  

**Data Source:**  
Survey data from HR containing job title, department, number of projects, monthly hours, tenure, work accidents, promotions, and salaries.

**Dataset Size:**  
- **Rows:** 15,000 employees  
- **Columns:** 10
