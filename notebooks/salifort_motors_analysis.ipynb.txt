# 🏭 Salifort Motors: Employee Turnover Prediction

## 📌 Plan Stage

In this project, I am a data professional working for a fictional company called **Salifort Motors**.  
Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among employees, including both voluntary resignations and terminations.  
This turnover is costly for the company due to recruitment, training, and productivity loss.

**Objective:**  
- Build a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will stay or leave.  
- Identify the most influential factors contributing to turnover.  

**Data Source:**  
Survey data from HR containing job title, department, number of projects, monthly hours, tenure, work accidents, promotions, and salaries.

**Dataset Size:**  
- **Rows:** 15,000 employees  
- **Columns:** 10  

| Variable               | Description |

| satisfaction_level     | Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0–1] |
| last_evaluation        | Score of employee’s last performance review [0–1] |
| number_project         | Number of projects employee contributes to |

## PACE: Plan Stage

In this project, I am a data professional working for a fictional company called Salifort Motors.
Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees (this includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go).
I have been tasked with building a machine learning model that could predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees. This is meant to be built from a survey carried out by the HR department.
The survey data includes job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and
any other relevant data points.
The dataset that I’ll be using in this lab contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below.
